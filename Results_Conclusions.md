# ARC - Results and Conclusions
The ARC Challenge accompanied us for 14 weeks. Many ideas were exchanged in brainstorming phases, many things were tried out.
Even if we cannot present "THE" solution of the ARC Challenge in the end, we can still take a lot from this. (WIP)

## Results
As it was already reported in [FuzzyLogic](FuzzyLogic.md) it turned out to be more difficult than expected to apply the Fuzzylogic to the ARC problems.
Possible reasons for this are:

## Conclusions
If we now look back over the past 14 weeks, we can look back on a time that was exciting,
instructive but also a time marked by highs and lows. 
Our enthusiasm and motivation to be able to develop a solution for ARC was questioned one or the other time during the course of the project.
Again and again we had to realize
that our ideas and solutions proved to be difficult to implement.
Nevertheless, we remained confident until the end that we would be able to deliver a correct test. However, since the remaining time gave us a limit in the implementation phase,
this could not be achieved. But nevertheless very important insights and experiences could be gained for us.

### Our next steps
Since this year's ARC-Challenge is over and we unfortunately could not reach a complete solution
(reasons for this were already mentioned under "Results") we would now like to show the next steps of the "Hitchhikers" in the ARC-Challenge.
